# School-Supply-Retail-Store-Site-suitability-Analysis-on-PostGIS
===============================================================================================
The purpose of this site suitability analysis is to find potential locations for constructing a
new school supply-retail store (e.g. Staples, Dollarama) in the city of Mississauga.
This study revolves around site suitability analysis because we wanted to understand the
decisions firms have to make when planning for new store locations while simultaneously
considering a strategy for maximizing revenue and customer reach, as well as minimizing
competition and potential damage from water hazards.

In summary, our site suitability analysis successfully filtered and identified vacant land that
conforms to our criteria using a combination of PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension for
spatial/non-spatial querying, and QGIS for the followed-up data visualization as a static map.
